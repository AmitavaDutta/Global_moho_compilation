# Global moho 

### spline_crust.py : This is a python script for generating the spline and the weighted moho as xarray and netCDF files.

Global_crust.csv : This datafile has the record of global crustal structure obtained from predominantly Receiver Function Analysis and few other seismological studies.
Crust1.0 : In this directory we have the Crust1.0 global data in csv and various other formats that are readable using GMT.

1) Crust_Map_No_parallel_computation.ipynb : This is the original script [If needed to change something from scratch this script can be used]
2) Crust_Map.ipynb : This jupyterlab is under development. We are generating the spline and weighted moho dataframes and visualizing the global crustal structure using matplotlib
3) Global_crust.csv is the master file for crustal data and related informations compiled from a bunch of literature. This file is subject to further updates.
