# Crust

## spline_crust.py : This is the final script for geberating the spline and the weighted moho as xarray and netCDF files.

1) Crust_Map_No_parallel_computation.ipynb : This is the original script
2) Crust_Map.ipynb : This jupyterlab is under development. We are generating the spline and weighted moho dataframes and visualizing the global crustal structure using matplotlib
3) Global_crust.csv is the master file for crustal data and related informations compiled from a bunch of literature. This file is subject to further updates.
